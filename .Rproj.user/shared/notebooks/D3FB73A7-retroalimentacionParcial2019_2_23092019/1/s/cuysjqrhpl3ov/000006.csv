"2","‘getSymbols’ currently uses auto.assign=TRUE by default, but will
use auto.assign=FALSE in 0.5-0. You will still be able to use
‘loadSymbols’ to automatically load data. getOption(""getSymbols.env"")
and getOption(""getSymbols.auto.assign"") will still be checked for
alternate defaults.

This message is shown once per session and may be disabled by setting 
options(""getSymbols.warning4.0""=FALSE). See ?getSymbols for details.
